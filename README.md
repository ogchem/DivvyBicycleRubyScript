# DivvyBicycleRubyScript
Ruby Script for Divvy Bicycle Set. 

This is a R script for the Divvy Data Set provided through the Google Data Analytics Certification course. Almost all of the script was provided by Kevin Hartman. This is part of the capstone project for the certification. I will be adding more to this the more I explore this dataset. I added on details to help those who don't understand the functions and what they do.
